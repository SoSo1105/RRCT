# This folder contains my implementation of RRCT in Python.

This file has not been optimized for speed and was developed as proof of concept to replicate my results in MATLAB. 
Quite likely the implementation can be made considerably faster. Given the choice prefer to run MATLAB.

I would appreciate if you make a computationally more efficient function of RRCT if you email me.
